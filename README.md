To run this project make sure that you have at least **JDK 7** and **Maven 3.0.5** installed and configured properly.
This project uses **Spring Boot** so it is pretty easy to build and run, the first step is to build the project : 
```bash
mvn clean install
```
The next step is to use the Spring Boot maven plugin to run the project :
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
